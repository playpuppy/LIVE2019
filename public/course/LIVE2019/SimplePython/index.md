# Simple Python

Puppy can be written like Python.

In addition to types such as int, str, you can write if statement, for statement, etc.

What is different from Python:

- Python required importing modules when using math. But with puppy you can write without import.
- In Puppy, it is allowed to write true as True.


Puppy is Python with free syntax.
