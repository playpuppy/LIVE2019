# Domino

With Puppy you can easily write dominoes.

If you specify the x coordinate using for statement, you can line up as many dominoes in one line.

Puppy environment automatically inserts the interval, so your code will not be executed at the same time.

After the dominoes are lined up, the objects that push the first domino will fall.

Since puppy has a physics engine, you don't need to set gravity.
